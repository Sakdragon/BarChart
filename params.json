More documentation for this library is coming soon - along with a large amount of new features!\r\n\r\n![Screenshot on iPad and iPhone](https://github.com/iRareMedia/BarChart/raw/master/Screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n## Integration\r\nFollow these steps to add Bar Chart to your iOS App project in Xcode. Check the [compatibility requirements](https://github.com/iRareMedia/BarChart/blob/master/README.md#compatibility-requirements) to make sure you can use Bar Chart in your project.\r\n\r\n 1. Add the CoreGraphics and QuartzCore Frameworks to your project  \r\n 2. Add the Bar Chart files to your project (can be found in the folder titled *BarChart Library*)  \r\n 3. Import Bar Chart into your View Controller: `#import \"BarChartView.h\"`  \r\n 4. Create a Bar Chart View in your interface and set its class to `BarChartView`\r\n 5. Connect the Bar Chart View to your ViewController Class: `@property (strong, nonatomic) IBOutlet BarChartView *barChart;`\r\n 6. Loading data into the Bar Chart can be done using an `XML file` or with an `NSArray`. Please refer to one of the sections below about loading data.\r\n\r\n##Loading Data with NSArray\r\nFilling your Bar Chart with data from an NSArray is the easiest and most flexible way to setup and load data into a `BarChartView`. Bar Chart provides a simple method that properly formats and generates an `NSArray` for use with a Bar Chart. Here's how you can easily generate data for a Bar Chart:\r\n\r\n    //Generate properly formatted data to give to the bar chart\r\n    NSArray *array = [barChart createChartDataWithTitles:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:@\"Title 1\", @\"Title 2\", @\"Title 3\", @\"Title 4\", nil]\r\n                                                  values:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:@\"4.7\", @\"8.3\", @\"17\", @\"5.4\", nil]\r\n                                                  colors:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:@\"87E317\", @\"17A9E3\", @\"E32F17\", @\"FFE53D\", nil]\r\n                                             labelColors:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:@\"FFFFFF\", @\"FFFFFF\", @\"FFFFFF\", @\"FFFFFF\", nil]];\r\n                                             \r\nAs you can see, there are four different arrays you must pass as a parameter (none of the arrays can be nil, and they all must have the same number of objects). The first array, `Titles`, should contain the labels for each bar on the X-Axis from left to right. The second array, `values`, should contain the value of each bar from left to right. The last two arrays, `colors` and `labelColors`, should contain HEX values for each bar and its label from left to right.\r\n\r\nThe above method returns an `NSArray` if the arrays are properly formatted, if not the method will return `nil` and an error will be printed in the log.\r\n\r\n##Loading Data with XML\r\nTo properly display and parse your data into a bar graph, Bar Chart must be given an XML file to read in the following format with the following attributes:\r\n\r\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n    <chart>\r\n        <set label=\"T1\" value=\"19\" color=\"3e5273\" labelColor=\"3e5273\"/>\r\n        <set label=\"T2\" value=\"41\" color=\"F0230C\" labelColor=\"F0230C\"/>\r\n        <set label=\"T3\" value=\"101\" color=\"566967\" labelColor=\"566967\"/>\r\n    </chart> \r\n\r\nIt is important that all four attributes are present in each set, otherwise there may be an error or exception while creating the Bar Chart. Colors must be HEX values, they cannot be RGB or UIColor. Refer to the [`barChart.xml`](https://github.com/iRareMedia/BarChart/blob/master/BarChart/Data/barChart.xml) file to see an example of how to format your data.\r\n\r\nOnce you create and format an XML file, you can then load it into a Bar Chart using the following method:\r\n\r\n    //Load the bar chart with a premade XML file in your app's bundle\r\n    [barChart setXmlData:[NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@\"barChart\" ofType:@\"xml\"]] showAxis:DisplayBothAxes withColor:[UIColor whiteColor] shouldPlotVerticalLines:YES];\r\n\r\nNote that you must give the XML File as an `NSData` object, not a file or file path.\r\n\r\n##Customizing Bar Chart\r\nCustomizing Bar Chart is easy. Bar Chart has three different types that allow for customization of the Bar Graph's Bars. More ways to customize Bar Chart are coming soon.\r\n\r\n###Bar Display Style\r\nChanges the visual appearance of the bars on the Bar Chart. There are three different styles available:  \r\n  * **BarStyleGlossy**: Adds a glossy shine and shades the bars. This is the default value if no value is set.   \r\n  * **BarStyleMatte**: Bars have shading but no gloss effects.  \r\n  * **BarStyleFlat**: Bars no no effects and are a solid flat color.  \r\n\r\nYou can set the Bar Style using the following method. You should always call this method before you update or load your Bar Chart:\r\n\r\n    //Set the Style of the Bars (Glossy, Matte, or Flat) - Glossy is default\r\n    [barChart setupBarViewStyle:BarStyleGlossy];\r\n    \r\n###Bar Shape\r\nChanges the shape of the bars on the Bar Chart. There are two different styles available:  \r\n  * **BarShapeRounded**: Rounds the corners of the bars at the top. This is the default value if no value is set.   \r\n  * **BarShapeSquared**: Bars are not rounded - they are rectangles.    \r\n\r\nYou can set the Bar Shape using the following method. You should always call this method before you update or load your Bar Chart:\r\n\r\n    //Set the Shape of the Bars (Rounded or Squared) - Rounded is default\r\n    [barChart setupBarViewShape:BarShapeRounded];\r\n\r\n###Bar Shadow\r\nChanges the visual appearance of the shadow behind the bars on the Bar Chart. There are three different shadow styles available:  \r\n  * **BarShadowLight**: Bars have a light gray shadow with a slight blur and low opacity. This is the default value if no value is set.   \r\n  * **BarShadowHeavy**: Bars have a dark and (relative compared to the light shadow) defined shadow.  \r\n  * **BarShadowNone**: No QuartzCore Shadow is added to the bars - they lie flat against the Bar Chart.  \r\n\r\nYou can set the Bar Style using the following method. You should always call this method before you update or load your Bar Chart:\r\n\r\n    //Set the Drop Shadow of the Bars (Light, Heavy, or None) - Light is default\r\n    [barChart setupBarViewShadow:BarShadowLight];\r\n\r\n##Compatibility Requirements\r\nBefore using Bar Chart, make sure your project meets its requirements.  \r\n - Bar Chart works on iOS 4.2 and higher, however the sample project only runs on iOS 5.0 and higher.  \r\n - Bar Chart now uses Objective-C ARC. If your project does not use ARC, add the ARC flag to the **Bar Chart** files in your project's Compile Sources section: `-fobjc-arc`  \r\n - You must add the `CoreGraphics` and `QuartzCore` frameworks to your project   \r\n\r\n##To-Do\r\nBar Chart is a work in progress. We're planning to add these features soon:  \r\n [ ] Re-add animations to Bar Chart\r\n [x] Add ways to customize Bar Chart\r\n [ ] Add Stroke Effetcs Options to Bars\r\n [ ] Add more data options (ex. using `UIColor` rather than `HEX`)\r\n Think of anything else? Submit an issue!\r\n\r\n##Changelog\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr><th colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><b>Version 3.0</b></th></tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Setup a Bar Chart using only Storyboards / XIBs.
