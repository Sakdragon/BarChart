BarChart is easy to integrate with your existing or new iOS projects, allows for styling and easy customization, and provides multiple methods to easily populate your bar graph with data from a variety of sources (XML, NSArray, or NSDictionary).\r\n\r\n![Screenshot on iPad and iPhone](https://github.com/iRareMedia/BarChart/raw/master/Screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n## Integration\r\nFollow these steps to add Bar Chart to your iOS App project in Xcode. Check the [compatibility requirements](https://github.com/iRareMedia/BarChart/blob/master/README.md#compatibility-requirements) to make sure you can use Bar Chart in your project.\r\n\r\n 1. Add the CoreGraphics and QuartzCore Frameworks to your project  \r\n 2. Add the Bar Chart files to your project (can be found in the folder titled *BarChart Library*)  \r\n 3. Import Bar Chart into your View Controller: `#import \"BarChartView.h\"`  \r\n 4. Create a Bar Chart View in your interface and set its class to `BarChartView`\r\n 5. Connect the Bar Chart View to your ViewController Class: `@property (strong, nonatomic) IBOutlet BarChartView *barChart;`\r\n 6. Loading data into the Bar Chart can be done using an `XML file` or with an `NSArray`. Please refer to one of the sections below about loading data.\r\n\r\n##Loading Data with NSArray\r\nFilling your Bar Chart with data from an NSArray is the easiest and most flexible way to setup and load data into a `BarChartView`. Bar Chart provides a simple method that properly formats and generates an `NSArray` for use with a Bar Chart. Here's how you can easily generate data for a Bar Chart:\r\n\r\n    // Generate properly formatted data to give to the bar chart\r\n    NSArray *array = [barChart createChartDataWithTitles:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:@\"Title 1\", @\"Title 2\", nil]\r\n                                                  values:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:@\"5.7\", @\"8.3\", nil]\r\n                                                  colors:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:[UIColor redColor], [UIColor blueColor], nil]\r\n                                             labelColors:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:[UIColor darkGrayColor], [UIColor darkGrayColor], nil]];\r\n                                             \r\nAs you can see, there are four different arrays you must pass as a parameter (none of the arrays can be nil, and they all must have the same number of objects). The first array, `Titles`, should contain the labels for each bar on the X-Axis from left to right. The second array, `values`, should contain the value of each bar from left to right. The last two arrays, `colors` and `labelColors`, should contain either `UIColor` objects OR HEX strings for each bar and its label from left to right.\r\n\r\nThe above method returns an `NSArray` if the arrays are properly formatted, if not the method will return `nil` and an error will be printed in the log.\r\n\r\n##Loading Data with XML\r\nTo properly display and parse your data into a bar graph, Bar Chart must be given an XML file to read in the following format with the following attributes:\r\n\r\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n    <chart>\r\n        <set label=\"T1\" value=\"19\" color=\"3e5273\" labelColor=\"3e5273\"/>\r\n        <set label=\"T2\" value=\"41\" color=\"F0230C\" labelColor=\"F0230C\"/>\r\n        <set label=\"T3\" value=\"101\" color=\"566967\" labelColor=\"566967\"/>\r\n    </chart> \r\n\r\nIt is important that all four attributes are present in each set, otherwise there may be an error or exception while creating the Bar Chart. Colors must be HEX values, they cannot be RGB or UIColor. Refer to the [`barChart.xml`](https://github.com/iRareMedia/BarChart/blob/master/BarChart/Data/barChart.xml) file to see an example of how to format your data.\r\n\r\nOnce you create and format an XML file, you can then load it into a Bar Chart using the following method:\r\n\r\n    //Load the bar chart with a premade XML file in your app's bundle\r\n    [barChart setXmlData:[NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@\"barChart\" ofType:@\"xml\"]] showAxis:DisplayBothAxes withColor:[UIColor whiteColor] shouldPlotVerticalLines:YES];\r\n\r\nNote that you must give the XML File as an `NSData` object, not a file or file path.\r\n\r\n##Customizing Bar Chart\r\nCustomizing Bar Chart is easy. Bar Chart can be customized based on style, shape, shadow, and animation. Easy to use methods and types are available to custimze BarChart.\r\n\r\n###Bar Display Style\r\nChanges the visual appearance of the bars on the Bar Chart. There are three different styles available:  \r\n  * **BarStyleGlossy**: Adds a glossy shine and shades the bars. This is the default value if no value is set.   \r\n  * **BarStyleMatte**: Bars have shading and gradients but no gloss effects.  \r\n  * **BarStyleFair**: Bars have subtle vertical gradients, sans gloss and extra shading.    \r\n  * **BarStyleFlat**: Bars have no effects and are a solid flat color.  \r\n\r\nYou can set the Bar Style using the following method. You should always call this method before you update or load your Bar Chart:\r\n\r\n    //Set the Style of the Bars (Glossy, Matte, Fair, or Flat) - Glossy is default\r\n    [barChart setupBarViewStyle:BarStyleGlossy];\r\n    \r\n###Bar Shape\r\nChanges the shape of the bars on the Bar Chart. There are two different styles available:  \r\n  * **BarShapeRounded**: Rounds the corners of the bars at the top. This is the default value if no value is set.   \r\n  * **BarShapeSquared**: Bars are not rounded - they are rectangles.    \r\n\r\nYou can set the Bar Shape using the following method. You should always call this method before you update or load your Bar Chart:\r\n\r\n    //Set the Shape of the Bars (Rounded or Squared) - Rounded is default\r\n    [barChart setupBarViewShape:BarShapeRounded];\r\n\r\n###Bar Shadow\r\nChanges the visual appearance of the shadow behind the bars on the Bar Chart. There are three different shadow styles available:  \r\n  * **BarShadowLight**: Bars have a light gray shadow with a slight blur and low opacity. This is the default value if no value is set.   \r\n  * **BarShadowHeavy**: Bars have a dark and (relative compared to the light shadow) defined shadow.  \r\n  * **BarShadowNone**: No QuartzCore Shadow is added to the bars - they lie flat against the Bar Chart.  \r\n\r\nYou can set the Bar Style using the following method. You should always call this method before you update or load your Bar Chart:\r\n\r\n    //Set the Drop Shadow of the Bars (Light, Heavy, or None) - Light is default\r\n    [barChart setupBarViewShadow:BarShadowLight];\r\n\r\n###Bar Animation\r\nChanges the presentation animation of the bars on the Bar Chart. There are three different animation styles available (more coming soon):  \r\n  * **BarAnimationRise**: Bars will \"rise\" or grow up from the bottom of the chart to their specified height and value while fading in. This is the default value if no value is set.    \r\n  * **BarAnimationFloat**: Bars will float in from the middle of the chart and rest at their specified destinations and height while fading in.   \r\n  * **BarAnimationFade**: Bars will fade-in simultaneously when presented.  \r\n  * **BarAnimationNone**: Bars suddenly appear without any animation.  \r\n\r\nYou can set the Bar Style using the following method. You should always call this method before you update or load your Bar Chart:\r\n\r\n    //Set the Initial Animation of the Bars (Rise, Fade, Float, or None) - Rise is default\r\n    [barChart setupBarViewAnimation:BarAnimationRise];\r\n\r\n##Delegates\r\nDelegates are new in release 4.2 of BarChart. Currently, there are two delegate methods available and an easy to setup delegate property. Follow the instructions below to setup BarChart's delegate.\r\n\r\n###Setup\r\nSelect the BarChart view in your Xcode Storyboard or XIB. Then select the Connections Inspector inside of the Utilities Pane. An outlet titled `barViewDelegate` should be listed under **Outlets**. Drag the `barViewDelegate` to your parent view controller. The picture below shows how this is done.\r\n\r\n![BarChart Delegate Setup](https://github.com/iRareMedia/BarChart/raw/master/DelegateSetup.png)\r\n\r\nNext, open your ViewController's header file and subscribe to the `BarViewDelegate`. Your `@interface` line should look something like this:\r\n\r\n    @interface RootController : UIViewController <BarViewDelegate>\r\n    \r\nThen add any of the following **optional** delegate methods to your implementation.\r\n\r\n    - (BOOL)barChartItemDisplaysPopoverOnTap\r\n\r\n    - (void)barChartItemTapped:(BarView *)barView\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the Demo App to see exactly how this works or how to set it up.\r\n\r\n###Optional Methods\r\nThere are currently only two delegate methods available, both of which are optional. The first delegate method, `barChartItemDisplaysPopoverOnTap`, tells BarChart whether it should display the *Popover* when the user taps on a bar. The popovers show the exact numerical value of the bar. This method **must** return a value.\r\n\r\n    - (BOOL)barChartItemDisplaysPopoverOnTap {\r\n        // Return YES to enable popups above bars when they're tapped. Popups will show the exact value of the bar. Return NO to disable popups. The default is YES. \r\n        return YES;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe second delegate method, `barChartItemTapped:`, is called when the user taps on a bar. This delegate method is always called regardless of the value returned in `barChartItemDisplaysPopoverOnTap`. The `barView` parameter contains a BarView object that contains all kinds of information about the bar that was tapped.\r\n\r\n    - (void)barChartItemTapped:(BarView *)barView {\r\n        NSLog(@\"Bar Chart Item Tapped: %@\", barView); // Printing the BarView object will print the bar's color and value in the log\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n##Compatibility Requirements\r\nBefore using Bar Chart, make sure your project meets its requirements. \r\n\r\n###BarChart Requirements\r\n - Supported build target - iOS 6.1 (Xcode 4.6, Apple LLVM compiler 4.2)\r\n - Earliest supported deployment target - iOS 5.0\r\n - Earliest compatible deployment target - iOS 4.2\r\n - Bar Chart now uses Objective-C ARC. If your project does not use ARC, add the ARC flag to the **Bar Chart** files in your project's Compile Sources section: `-fobjc-arc`  \r\n - You must add the `CoreGraphics` and `QuartzCore` frameworks to your project  \r\n \r\nNOTE: **Supported** means that the library has been tested with this version. **Compatible** means that the library should work on this OS version (it doesn't rely on any unavailable SDK features) but is no longer being tested for compatibility and may require tweaking or bug fixes to run correctly.\r\n\r\n###Demo App Requirements\r\n - The Bar Chart Demo App works on iOS 5.0 and higher  \r\n - The Bar Chart Demo App requires Xcode 5.0 or greater\r\n\r\n##To-Do\r\nBar Chart is a work in progress. Please check the milestones / issues section of the Repo page for more details. Submit an issue if you'd like to see something added or fixed.\r\n\r\n##Changelog\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tr><th colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"><b>Version 4.3</b></th></tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>This version makes improvements towards the 5.0 milestone.
